6) it throws an exception
7) The parentheses are required, but the braces are ot because there is only one statemnet in this code. 
8) the code compiles with no errors because it conforms to the rules of syntax, but the messaage still wont move across 
   because ; signifies the end of a statement which changes how to code is read. 
9) (when it shows up when im not in the editing modeit doesnt seem to format correctly let me know if it looks correct when you view it)

      System.out.println(lineCount);
      lineCount ++;
    }
    return true;
  }

  a) the program runs but the title bar is empty because the constructor from JFrame is not called because the part was
